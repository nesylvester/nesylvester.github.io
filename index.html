<br><h3> I am originally from a tiny little town in the middle of nowhere, Connecticut. In less than a month I'll be 24 years old, crazy! I live with my best friend who is also my boyfriend in Quincy, MA right now. I studied abroad in Australia my junior year at Suffolk University and there's not a day that goes by I don't miss it. Those who know me will tell you I have a silly sense of humor, I know what I want out of life, I love Beyonce (I named my cat after her) and I am eager to start a career in marketing! </h2>
